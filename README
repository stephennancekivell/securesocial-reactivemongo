A UserService for SecureSocial that uses MongoDB
================================================

Install locally with `sbt publish-local`

add `9998:com.stephenn.securesocialreactivemongo.MongoUserService` to your play.plugins

maybe I should get this added to maven central or something.

Tests need a local running mongodb.
